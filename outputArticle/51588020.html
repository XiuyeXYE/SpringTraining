# MySQL Server Instance Configuration File<br/>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
# Generated by the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard<br/>
#<br/>
#<br/>
# Installation Instructions<br/>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
#<br/>
# On Linux you can copy this file to /etc/my.cnf to set global options,<br/>
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options<br/>
# (@localstatedir@ for this installation) or to<br/>
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.<br/>
#<br/>
# On Windows you should keep this file in the installation directory <br/>
# of your server (e.g. C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y). To<br/>
# make sure the server reads the config file use the startup option <br/>
# &quot;--defaults-file&quot;. <br/>
#<br/>
# To run run the server from the command line, execute this in a <br/>
# command line shell, e.g.<br/>
# mysqld --defaults-file=&quot;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini&quot;<br/>
#<br/>
# To install the server as a Windows service manually, execute this in a <br/>
# command line shell, e.g.<br/>
# mysqld --install MySQLXY --defaults-file=&quot;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini&quot;<br/>
#<br/>
# And then execute this in a command line shell to start the server, e.g.<br/>
# net start MySQLXY<br/>
#<br/>
#<br/>
# Guildlines for editing this file<br/>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
#<br/>
# In this file, you can use all long options that the program supports.<br/>
# If you want to know the options a program supports, start the program<br/>
# with the &quot;--help&quot; option.<br/>
#<br/>
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be<br/>
# found in the manual.<br/>

# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it<br/>
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may<br/>

# set it too high.<br/>
innodb_buffer_pool_size=28M<br/>
